Oh, mighty lord of the evil realm
Open the gates to your dominion
Save me from this holy light
That makes me suffer like a pig

Satan, lead me to your throne
And make me one with Hell
I kneel before you, dark lord
And swear the unholy oath

Unholy master Satan, make my wish come true
Open wide your kingdom where all the evil rule
Lord of Hell, possess my soul
With thousand mad and insane demons
Lock up the seven gates
And bring out your infernal legions

Open the gates, Satan
Open the gates, Satan
Open the gates, Satan
Open the gates, Satan
